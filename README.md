# Simple Quiz Game

This is a simple quiz game implemented in Python. The game presents multiple-choice questions to the user, keeps track of their score, and provides feedback on their answers.

## Modules

The game consists of two Python modules:

1. `Simple_quiz_game.py`: This is the main module that runs the game. It imports questions and answers from the `Questions_and_Answers.py` module, presents them to the user, and keeps track of the score.

2. `Questions_and_Answers.py`: This module contains the questions and answers used in the quiz game. The questions are multiple-choice, and the answers are provided as a dictionary mapping question numbers to the correct choice.

## How to Run

To play the game, simply run the `Simple_quiz_game.py` script in Python. You will be presented with a series of questions and multiple-choice answers. Enter your choice for each question. The game will provide immediate feedback on your answer and keep track of your score.
